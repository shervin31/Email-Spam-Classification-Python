Description:

This project demonstrates how to build a robust email spam classification system using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

The system is capable of:

Preprocessing and transforming raw email text into structured data.

Engineering features such as email length, punctuation frequency, and term importance (TF-IDF).

Training multiple classification models to accurately distinguish between spam and non-spam emails.

Evaluating model performance with standard classification metrics.

Key Features:

Text Preprocessing: Applies standard NLP techniques including tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and vectorization to clean and transform email data.

Feature Engineering: Extracts and utilizes features like word count, email length, and frequency-based metrics to improve model performance.

Model Training: Trains and tunes various machine learning classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.

Evaluation: Assesses performance using cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to select the best-performing model.

Software:

Python: The primary language used for the entire workflow.

Jupyter Notebook: An interactive environment to develop and test models.

Libraries:

scikit-learn: Provides classification models, pipelines, and evaluation tools.

NLTK: Assists in processing human language data (e.g., stopword removal, stemming).

pandas: Enables loading, cleaning, and organizing the email dataset.

NumPy: Supports efficient operations on arrays and matrices.

Matplotlib / Seaborn: For visualizing model results and data insights.
